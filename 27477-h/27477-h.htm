<h2 class="gap3">Introduction.</h2>


<p>In the following pages we have endeavored to give to our customers
an idea of the line of astronomical instruments of the latest
and most improved types which we have constructed for some of the
leading observatories as mentioned in the text. We feel that this
series of illustrations may not only be of general interest, but also
of service in helping to determine further developments of modern
astronomical and astrophysical equipment. We have not thought
it advisable to describe in detail the various instruments of precision,
which we have been called upon to construct from time to time for
the scientists in the astronomical as well as other branches of science
during the last ten years. As a rule every astronomer is interested
in some special line of research, which for a successful investigation
requires a special adaptation of the instrument he proposes to use,
and in such cases we are confident we can fill the requirements and
shall be happy to correspond with interested parties. We are in
position to undertake the design of special apparatus and can furnish
sketches and estimates in accordance with the suggestions of
the customer on short notice in such cases, where the importance of
the prospective business will warrant it. Among the various instruments
which we have built, but which are not included in this
catalogue, we wish to mention, spectroheliographs, planetary cameras,
photographic plate holders, domes for observatories, etc.</p>

<p>The optical parts which we furnish are of the highest degree of
excellence and are made for us by several of the most reliable firms
in this line.</p>

<p>Mr. O. L. Petitdidier is closely located to our works, and during
the last ten years has supplied most of our objectives, etc.</p>

<p>It is and has been the aim of our firm to produce apparatus
of the highest grade and the constant growth of our business is a
mute but eloquent testimonial that our efforts have been appreciated
by our customers.</p>

<p>We are glad to acknowledge our indebtedness to many of the
foremost astronomers, who have greatly assisted us by suggestions
as to their particular requirements, and by supplying certain of the
photographs here reproduced.</p>

<p>We take this opportunity to thank our customers for the favors
rendered us in the past, and trust that in the future these mutually
pleasant relations may be renewed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A120. Portable Equatorial Mounting with Driving Clock.</b> This instrument
was designed to meet the demand for portable low priced telescope
suitable for the study of astronomy in the college, high school or for the
amateur astronomer. Every observer and teacher in astronomy will appreciate
the great usefulness of a driving mechanism, which will keep the
star in the field during observation. After several years of experimenting
we have succeeded in constructing a reliable clock which can easily be attached
to our portable telescope mounting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The instrument is mounted on strong hardwood tripod fitted with iron
shoes. It is attached to the tripod top by a single screw which holds it
firmly and allows adjustment in azimuth. The clock case carrying the bearing
for the polar axis is made to swivel in the base casting, so that the polar
axis may be easily set and firmly clamped at an angle from horizontal to
vertical. A level is fitted to the tripod top and a graduated arc is fastened
to the clock case. If the polar axis is set vertical and the worm wheel unclamped,
the instrument is transformed into an alt-azimuth mounting. This
feature will be found to be a great convenience especially for terrestrial
observations.</p>

<p>Both the polar and declination axes are carefully fitted to their bearings
and carry finding circles. The right ascension circle reads to 5 min., the
declination circle to single degrees. The declination axis is fitted with
clamp screw which is within convenient reach.</p>

<p>The clock has ample power and is enclosed in a heavy case which protects
it from dust and injury. It is driven by two strong springs and will
run about 12 hours without rewinding. A lever for starting or stopping is
provided. Motion from clock to polar axis is transmitted by means of a set
of bevel gears and worm and worm wheel. The worm wheel is held by
friction to the polar axis so that the telescope can be moved without loosening
any screw and without affecting the clock. The clock will give steady
and accurate motion to the telescope and with ordinary care it will keep in
good repair for years. A slow motion adjustment independent of the clock
is fitted to the polar axis.</p>

<p>With the instrument are furnished three celestial eye pieces giving a
magnifying power of about 50, 100 and 150 diameters respectively.</p>

<p>The instrument is easily portable, the total weight of a 3" telescope
being about 60 lbs. yet it is made heavy enough, and the material well distributed
to insure strength and steadiness. Workmanship and finish of the
instrument are the best. The brass parts are either lacquered yellow or
bronzed. The iron parts are durably enameled and all exposed steel parts
are nickel-plated.</p>

<h3>EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS ON IRON PILLAR
WITH DRIVING CLOCK, ETC.</h3>


<p>On page 10 is shown an illustration of our standard high grade type of
6 in. equatorial. A description of the same will apply to practically all
larger and smaller sizes.</p>

<p>The pillar is of rectangular cross section and well proportioned. The
clock case is securely fastened to the top of the pillar but with provision for
adjustment in azimuth. The clock has ample driving power, is very carefully
constructed and regulated by friction governor (Design Prof. Young.)
Maintaining gears are provided on the main shaft which allows the winding
of the clock without retarding motion. Worm wheel and worm are carefully
cut, and protected by brass shields. Right ascension and declination
circles have fine graduation on solid silver and coarse finding graduation on
the edge. Electric illumination and magnifying glasses are fitted to the
verniers. The handles for all clamps and slow motions are fastened conveniently
near the eye end of the telescope and are of different shape so as
to distinguish in the dark right ascension and declination. The axes are of
tool steel carefully fitted to their bearings, and on the larger instruments
friction rollers are fitted to the polar axis. The telescope tube is made of
steel, light but strongly constructed. The eye end has long and heavy rack
and pinion motion and the whole can be easily removed.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b>&mdash;The fine divided circles are often omitted on smaller equatorials,
as they are not essential, the electrical illumination for the circles is
also left off, and this will amount to a material saving.</p>

<p><b>A701. Chronograph</b> for physical and astronomical work. This
chronograph is designed to meet the demand for a medium sized, well-made
and accurate instrument of this kind and has given very good satisfaction.
The cylinder is 15 cm. in diameter 25 cm. long, driven by strong, carefully
made clock work, fitted with friction governor. Two different speeds for
the cylinder can be obtained by means of change gears. The slow speed of
the drum is one revolution per minute, and at this speed the drum will run
for a full hour. The fast speed is 30 seconds per revolution. The carriage
is driven by means of a screw, the nut of which is made to disengage
easily.</p>

<p><b>A702. Prof. G. W. Hough's Printing Chronograph.</b> The instrument consists
of two carefully and accurately constructed clock movements, which
are driven by gravity and controlled electrically by the sidereal clock.
The movements revolve three type wheels. One of these turns once per
second, its edge is divided in 50 parts and it is driven by a separate movement.
The second wheel turns once per minute and the third once per
hour and they will print the seconds and minutes, while the first will give
the hundredths of seconds. A strip of paper is carried over these wheels and
moved forward by the same electro-magnet, which operates the printing
hammers. The paper is sufficiently long for 1200 observations including
spacing between records. The operation of the printing hammers is such
that the uniform motion of the type wheel is not disturbed in the act of
printing. The whole instrument is mounted on a heavy slate plate 45 cm.
by 60 cm., and protected by a glass cover.</p>

<p>The manipulation of the apparatus is extremely simple and convenient
and the records obtained are perfectly reliable and accurate within about
0.01 of a second. The saving of time and labor by the printing chronograph
is very considerable and the filing of the records very convenient.</p>

<p>This printing chronograph has been in use at the Dearborn Observatory
for about twenty years and during the last five years the following observatories
have been equipped with the instrument: Amherst College Observatory;
Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland; Philadelphia Observatory;
Durham Observatory, Durham, England; Observatory of LaPlatta, Argentine;
and Dominion Observatory, Ottawa, Canada.</p>

<p><b>A1201. Small Comparator.</b> The instrument is intended for measuring spectra
photographs, gratings, divided scales, or such objects which can be
focused by the microscope and will allow rapid measurements of the highest
possible accuracy. The measurement depends on the accuracy of the micrometer
screw, which is cut and corrected with great care. The screw has
a pitch of .5 mm. and diameter of 15 mm. The index head attached to the
screw is of considerable diameter so as to allow the direct reading of .001 mm.
The head is divided on solid silver in 500 parts, and carries two rows of
figures indicating the first and second half of the mm. The full mm. are
read by means of a scale in front of the instrument. The bed plate is
heavy, of cast iron, and the guides are carefully scraped true within 0.001
mm. The carriage has a movement of 80 mm., is made of gun metal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
fitted exactly to the guides; it is also provided with a second or top carriage
with 40 mm. motion. The top carriage can be moved by hand and
accurately set by means of a micrometer screw. The microscope is of variable
magnifying power, focused by rack and pinion. Illumination for transparent
objects is given from below by means of a plane mirror. The instrument
is mounted on heavy supports, under an angle to make it convenient
for the observer. The instrument is finished in first-class manner, and the
iron bed plate heavily copper and nickel plated.</p>

turn the plate exactly 90 degrees so as to measure rectangular
coordinates. The guide carrying the measuring microscope is adjusted
exactly at right angles to the ways of the bed plate. The carriage
supporting the microscope is moved by rack and pinion. The microscope is
arranged to tilt, so as to view either the plate or the scale above. The
eye piece is provided with a reversing prism. Measurements are made on the
scale divided in millimeters. The smaller measurements, to 1-4000 of a mm.,
are made by the micrometer. The micrometer is fitted with sliding eye piece
and counter for full revolutions. The scale is not marked in the usual way
with single lines, but each millimeter is marked with a double line. This
double line allows the use of one single spider thread, which is preferable
to use for bisecting the star, and the double line on the scale allows a
